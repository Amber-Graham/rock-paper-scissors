# rock-paper-scissors
My first JavaScript program, from scratch, for TOP. 
Initially, this will only be the JavaScript portion, 
then I will come back later to add a GPU.

My goal is to approach this by first writing an
algorithm for the game, then coding it out.

// After writing the code:

my first attempt worked, but it was so difficult
to try and rework the old code that I decided 
to create a new file (rps.html) and start
over. I found a new way to code options
by doing a global variable. this was SO 
helpful!! I really enjoyed getting to see
a new way to do the same thing and learned 
a lot a bout how to use javascript DOM to my
own benefit. I may come back and do some more
edits later, but for now, the code works.
